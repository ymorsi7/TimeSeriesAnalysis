# Time-Series Analysis

This repository follows my path to learning about time-series analysis.

My steps are as follows:

- [Intel Course]("https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/topic-technology/artificial-intelligence/training/course-time-series-analysis.html")

- [Guided Coursera Course]("https://www.coursera.org/projects/time-series-data-visualization-techniques")

The intel course resources can be found in the "IntelTimeSeries" folder, and the project is in the "Project" folder
